# Prefabs

Prefabs are a way to store a GameObject and its components in a reusable form. You can create a prefab from a GameObject in the scene by dragging it from the hierarchy window to the project window. You can also create a prefab by selecting the GameObject in the hierarchy window and clicking on the `Create` button in the inspector window.

Prefabs are useful for creating multiple instances of the same GameObject in the scene. You can create a prefab from a GameObject and then instantiate it multiple times in the scene. If you make changes to the prefab, all instances of the prefab in the scene will be updated, which can save you time when making changes to multiple objects.
